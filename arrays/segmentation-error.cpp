/*
    Segmentation error occurs when you attempt to access memory that your program does not have permission to access.
    In C++, this will most often occur when you attempt to access an element of an array that is out of bounds.
    For example, if you have an array of size 5, and you attempt to access the element at index 5, this will cause a segmentation error.
    This is because the array is zero-indexed, so the last element is at index 4.
